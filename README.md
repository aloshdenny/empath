## Empath

Empath is a browser extension designed to help users track their mood over time. By simply writing about their day, the extension utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of their entries. The AI then provides insightful visual feedback, allowing users to observe their mood trends over days, weeks, or months.

## Features

Mood Analysis: The user could track their moods through journaling. Empath employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging the Hugging Face model Roberta, to analyze the sentiment of user entries.

Mood Visualization: Empath provides a dashboard for the users to gain a deeper understanding of their emotional well-being. It provides visual feedback to represent the user's mood trends over specific time periods. The graphs will show the top 3 behaviour of the user over specific time periods, from the input collected from the user's journals. And every time when the extension is being accessed, the dashboard page will get refreshed, so the user would get a broader understanding of their behaviour patterns.
